 # Internet Cryptography, a playground created by Antoine Bellanger for WWDC 2017.
 
 ## Why this project ? ##
 
 I had to find an idea of a playground for WWDC2017. For my studies, I have to write an article about Quantum Cryptography (a subject I choose) and I have an introduction part on "classical" cryptography and RSA.
 This was perfect, I linked my studies to WWDC. I have a functional playground, I understand now way more better RSA and I can add this to my article.
 
 ## Thanks for trying it !
