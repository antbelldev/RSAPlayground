 # Welcome to Internet Cryptography, a playground created by Antoine Bellanger for WWDC 2017.
 This playground will demonstrate you in less than three minutes an example of how cryptography work on the Internet.

 This example will illustrate in simple terms how RSA works. What is RSA ?
 RSA is an asymetrical crptography or public key cryptography.
 It uses a pair of keys to encrypt and decrypt the data but we will see this on the next page with the hands-on.
